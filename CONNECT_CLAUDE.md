# Connect Claude Desktop to VIGIL

## What happens when Claude connects

1. Claude opens an SSE stream to `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/mcp`
2. VIGIL assigns Claude a session ID and starts tracking it as an agent
3. Every tool call Claude makes (read_file, search_code, run_command…) is:
   - Metered for cost against a $5 per-session budget
   - Broadcast via WebSocket to the Mission Control dashboard
   - Logged in the MCP sessions list
4. When cost exceeds the budget, VIGIL sends Claude a **"Blocked by VIGIL Firewall"** error
5. You can kill/pause/resume Claude from the Mission Control page in real time

---

## Step 1 — Start the VIGIL backend

```bash
cd ~/Wins/Subnet-ZK-Compose
go run cmd/vigil-server/main.go
```

You should see:
```
INFO VIGIL server starting addr=:8080 org_id=default
INFO vigil: MCP server initialized endpoint=/api/v1/mcp
```

**Optional — enable demo agents on startup:**
```bash
VIGIL_DEMO_MODE=true go run cmd/vigil-server/main.go
```

---

## Step 2 — Start the frontend

```bash
cd ~/Wins/Subnet-ZK-Compose/frontend
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** → you should see the VIGIL dashboard.

---

## Step 3 — Connect Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop uses a config file. Add the VIGIL MCP server to it.

### Linux path
```
~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

### macOS path
```
~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

### Config to add

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vigil": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

A ready-made copy is at `agent-skills/claude_desktop_config.json` in this repo.

**Quick install on Linux:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/Claude
cp agent-skills/claude_desktop_config.json ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

**Quick install on macOS:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude
cp agent-skills/claude_desktop_config.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

---

## Step 4 — Restart Claude Desktop

Fully quit Claude (Cmd+Q / right-click tray → Quit) and reopen it.
In Claude's tool selector you should see **"vigil"** listed as an MCP server with 12 tools.

---

## Step 5 — Run the demo

In Claude, type:
```
Analyze this massive codebase at /home/bajrangi/Wins/Subnet-ZK-Compose and write a detailed summary of every component.
```

**Watch the VIGIL dashboard:**
- Mission Control → agent appears, cost counter ticking up live
- Cost Firewall → burn rate chart spikes as Claude calls tools
- When cost hits $5.00 → Claude receives "VIGIL Firewall: Budget exceeded. Connection blocked."

## Change the budget limit

Default is **$5 per session** and **$100 total** for the server.

Per-session budget (via API):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/mcp/sessions/<session-id>/budget \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"budget": 10.0}'
```

Server-wide budget:
```bash
VIGIL_BUDGET_LIMIT=50 go run cmd/vigil-server/main.go
```

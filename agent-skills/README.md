# SigNoz Agent Skills

Official SigNoz skills and MCP configuration for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor,
Gemini CLI, Devin CLI, Antigravity CLI, and the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) ecosystem. The MCP setup skill also
includes client-specific recipes for VS Code/GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop,
Gemini CLI, Devin CLI, Windsurf, Zed, Antigravity CLI, OpenCode, and generic HTTP
MCP clients.

## Installation

The Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor plugins ship with MCP registration files so
users do not have to hand-edit MCP configuration. Claude Code asks for the MCP
endpoint URL during install. Codex and Cursor can use `signoz-mcp-setup` when an
endpoint needs to be initialized or repaired; it accepts a SigNoz Cloud region
such as `us`, `us2`, `eu`, `eu2`, `in`, or `in2`, any hosted MCP URL, or a
self-hosted HTTP `/mcp` endpoint. Plugin updates can reset bundled MCP
registration files to the placeholder; if that happens, rerun
`signoz-mcp-setup`.

The Devin CLI plugin ships skills only — Devin's plugin system does not bundle
MCP servers or prompt for install-time config. Run `signoz-mcp-setup` after
installing to write the `signoz` MCP server into `.devin/config.json`.

The skills are authored against the current SigNoz MCP server contract. If a
tool call fails because a parameter or schema looks different from what a skill
describes, update or reconfigure the SigNoz MCP server before changing the
workflow.

See the full setup guide in the [SigNoz MCP Server docs](https://signoz.io/docs/ai/signoz-mcp-server/).

### Claude Code

```sh
/plugin marketplace add SigNoz/agent-skills
/plugin install signoz@signoz-skills
```

On install, Claude Code prompts for your **SigNoz MCP endpoint**. For SigNoz
Cloud, keep the default `https://mcp.us.signoz.cloud/mcp` or edit the region
segment to your region (`us`, `us2`, `eu`, `eu2`, `in`, or `in2`). Find your
region under **Settings -> Ingestion** in SigNoz, or see the
[region reference](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/). For a
self-hosted SigNoz, enter your own HTTP `/mcp` URL, for example
`http://localhost:8000/mcp`.

Then run `/mcp`, select the `signoz` server, and complete the authentication
flow if prompted. To change the endpoint later, reconfigure the plugin's options
or run `signoz-mcp-setup` with the new region or MCP URL.

Update:

```sh
/plugin marketplace update
/plugin update signoz@signoz-skills
```

> The plugin ships a `PreToolUse` hook that auto-allows `WebFetch` to `signoz.io` domains. This does not affect `Bash`-based network calls (`curl`, `wget`), which follow the normal permission flow.

### Codex

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add SigNoz/agent-skills
```

Then, in a Codex session started from your project:

1. Run `/plugins`, open the `SigNoz` marketplace, and install `signoz`.
2. Run `signoz-mcp-setup <region>` with your SigNoz Cloud region (`us`, `us2`,
   `eu`, `eu2`, `in`, `in2`) or a self-hosted HTTP MCP URL. This rewrites the
   bundled `.mcp.json` placeholder used by the Codex plugin to a concrete
   endpoint.
3. Authenticate the MCP server over OAuth:

   ```sh
   codex mcp login signoz
   ```

   Complete the browser flow with your SigNoz instance URL and a service account
   API key.
4. Verify the connection:

   ```sh
   codex mcp list   # signoz -> enabled, Auth = logged in
   ```

   or run `/mcp` in a session, then call any `signoz_*` tool. Restart Codex if
   the `signoz` server does not appear.

The bundled `.mcp.json` lives inside Codex's versioned plugin cache, so plugin
updates reinstall that file from this repository and can reset it to the
placeholder. If you want the endpoint to persist across plugin updates, also
add a native Codex MCP entry after resolving the endpoint:

```sh
codex mcp add signoz --url http://localhost:8000/mcp
```

Replace the URL with your SigNoz Cloud MCP URL or self-hosted HTTP `/mcp`
endpoint. Verify with `codex mcp get signoz`.

The Codex plugin declares `mcpServers: "./.mcp.json"`, so normal plugin installs
do not need a separate native Codex MCP entry. To use in another repo, copy
`plugins/signoz` into the target repo's `plugins/` directory, add a marketplace
entry in `$REPO_ROOT/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, and repeat the setup
step for that workspace.

### Cursor

Not yet on the public Cursor Marketplace. Install via a Team Marketplace:

1. Add `https://github.com/SigNoz/agent-skills` as a team marketplace in `Settings -> Plugins`.
2. Install the `signoz` plugin from the marketplace panel.

On install, Cursor prompts for your **SigNoz Region**. The picker offers the
SigNoz Cloud regions (`us`, `us2`, `eu`, `eu2`, `in`, `in2`) plus a
**`self-hosted`** option:

- **SigNoz Cloud** — select your region. The bundled MCP config fills it into
  `https://mcp.<region>.signoz.cloud/mcp` and Cursor starts the OAuth login.
  Find your region under **Settings -> Ingestion** in SigNoz, or see the
  [region reference](https://signoz.io/docs/ingestion/signoz-cloud/keys/).
- **Self-hosted** — choose `self-hosted`. This skips the Cloud OAuth and leaves
  the MCP endpoint unconfigured. After install you **must** run
  `/signoz-mcp-setup` with your own HTTP `/mcp` URL (next step) to point Cursor
  at your instance.

3. **Self-hosted only:** run `/signoz-mcp-setup` in an agent chat with your
   self-hosted HTTP MCP URL (for example `/signoz-mcp-setup http://localhost:8000/mcp`).
   This updates the bundled `.signoz_cursor_mcp.json` placeholder used by the
   Cursor plugin. (SigNoz Cloud users can skip this — the region picker already
   configured the endpoint.)
4. Reload Cursor, then open MCP settings and complete authentication for the
   `signoz` server if prompted.

If you picked the wrong region or need to change a self-hosted HTTP MCP
endpoint, run `/signoz-mcp-setup` again with the correct region or URL and
reload Cursor.

### Gemini CLI

```sh
gemini extensions install https://github.com/SigNoz/agent-skills
```

When prompted for the **SigNoz MCP endpoint**, enter:

- **SigNoz Cloud:** `https://mcp.<region>.signoz.cloud/mcp` — replace `<region>` with
  your region (`us`, `us2`, `eu`, `eu2`, `in`, or `in2`). The default is the `us`
  Cloud endpoint.
- **Self-hosted SigNoz:** your own `/mcp` URL, for example `http://localhost:8000/mcp`.

Then authenticate:

```
/mcp auth signoz
```

Follow the prompts to enter your SigNoz instance URL and API key.

### Devin CLI

```sh
devin plugins install SigNoz/agent-skills
```

This installs at user level and works across all projects. Devin's plugin
system does not support bundled MCP servers or install-time config prompts, so
run `/signoz:signoz-mcp-setup` (Devin namespaces plugin skills as
`/<plugin>:<skill>`) in a Devin session afterward with your SigNoz Cloud
region (`us`, `us2`, `eu`, `eu2`, `in`, `in2`) or a self-hosted HTTP MCP URL.
This writes a `signoz` entry into the highest-precedence Devin config scope
that already has one, or `~/.config/devin/config.json` by default.

For SigNoz Cloud, start a new session and run `devin mcp login signoz` to
complete OAuth. For self-hosted SigNoz, no OAuth step is needed unless the
server runs with `OAUTH_ENABLED=true`.

### Antigravity CLI

Install directly from this repository — Antigravity CLI stages the repo root as
a native plugin (`plugin.json` + `mcp_config.json` + `skills/`):

```sh
agy plugin install https://github.com/SigNoz/agent-skills
agy plugin list   # confirm signoz is loaded
```

Reinstall with the same command to update. Antigravity registers the `signoz`
MCP server (default SigNoz Cloud `us` endpoint, `https://mcp.us.signoz.cloud/mcp`)
and the SigNoz skills automatically. The installed plugin is staged at
`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/plugins/signoz/`.

**Authenticate (SigNoz Cloud).** In the `agy` prompt, type `/mcp`, select the
`signoz` server, and choose **Authenticate** to start the OAuth flow. Complete
it in the browser (over SSH, `agy` prints an authorization URL to paste in and a
code to paste back). Self-hosted endpoints need no OAuth unless the server runs
with `OAUTH_ENABLED=true`.

**Change the endpoint.** In the `agy` prompt, run the setup skill with your
target — a SigNoz Cloud region or a self-hosted MCP URL:

```
/signoz:signoz-mcp-setup <region>        # e.g. us, us2, eu, eu2, in, in2
/signoz:signoz-mcp-setup <mcp-url>       # e.g. http://localhost:8000/mcp
```

This rewrites `serverUrl` in the installed `mcp_config.json`. Then run `/mcp` to
reload and re-authenticate (self-hosted needs no OAuth unless the server runs
with `OAUTH_ENABLED=true`). You can also edit the `serverUrl` value directly.

### Other MCP Clients

The setup skill includes native config recipes for VS Code/GitHub Copilot,
Claude Desktop, Gemini CLI, Devin CLI, Windsurf, Zed, Antigravity CLI, OpenCode,
and generic HTTP MCP clients. These clients do not all consume this plugin
automatically; install or copy the skill where your client supports skills, or
use the client-specific setup snippets in the skill as a reference.

For SigNoz Cloud, prefer the hosted MCP URL and client OAuth flow. For
self-hosted SigNoz, the skill supports HTTP `/mcp` endpoints and stdio
local-binary recipes. It avoids writing API keys into tracked project files.

## Slide 1: The Problem (Hook)
*(Visual: A chaotic web of AI agent traces, spiraling out of control)*

**Speaker:**
"Good morning everyone. Over the last year, we've seen a massive shift from passive Chatbots to Autonomous AI Agents. These agents use tools, they loop, they make decisions, and they execute code. 

But there's a fundamental problem. **Agents are unpredictable.**
They get stuck in infinite loops. They hallucinate. And they can burn through hundreds of dollars of API credits in minutes while you're asleep. 

Current observability tools just show you the crash after it happens. We need something that stops the crash in mid-air."

## Slide 2: The Solution (VIGIL)
*(Visual: The VIGIL Philosophy - Observe -> Understand -> Detect -> Take Action)*

**Speaker:**
"Enter VIGIL. The Autonomous Reliability Guardian.

VIGIL isn't just an observability dashboard. It is an **active immune system** for your AI runtime. It sits between your agents and your models, watching every move, every token, and every tool call."

## Slide 3: The Four Pillars
*(Visual: Icons representing Governance, Cost, DNA, and Replay)*

**Speaker:**
"VIGIL operates on four core engines:

1. **The Cost Firewall**: Block an agent the millisecond it exceeds its budget.
2. **The Governance Engine**: Detect infinite loops and retry storms in real-time.
3. **The Self-Healing Automator**: When an agent fails, VIGIL steps in. It can kill the run, reduce the context window, switch to a cheaper model, or escalate to a human.
4. **Agent DNA**: We algorithmically fingerprint every execution. If an agent starts using unapproved tools or behaving erratically, we detect the anomaly against a statistical baseline immediately."

## Slide 4: The Impact

**Speaker:**
"And we've built this for the enterprise. VIGIL deploys via Kubernetes, manages cost policies via Terraform, and alerts your team via Slack.

With VIGIL, you can finally trust your autonomous agents to run in production."
